    <string name="text_help_text">Q: What URL should I use to connect to ownCloud?\nA: Enter the same URL as you use when you visit your ownCloud instance in a web browser (eg: https://my.ownclou.de)\n\nQ: Are my notes secure while they synchronize?\nA: ownCloud doesn\'t provide encryption itself, and to make sure your notes stay private, you should check that either the connection to the webserver hosting ownCloud, or the network you\'re connecting to it over provide a level of security you\'re comfortable with.\n\nQ: What methods are available to connect securely to ownCloud using?\nA: There are a number of options, including:\n1:SSL: This is configured on the webserver using certificates that can verify the identify of who you\'re connecting to as well as provide security that should keep everyone but the NSA out.\n2:VPN: Standing for Virtual Private Network, it provides private, encrypted communication between you and any other computers on it that works similar to a LAN at home, except you can access it from over the Internet too.\n3:Darknet: Highly encrypted private decentralized networks can be created using routers like CJDNS, and hosting your ownCloud instance over one of these is likely one of the most secure options, though also less friendly than the other two options if you\'re less comfortable with computers.\n\nQ: The devs of the official MyOwnNotes project say they force the use of https because everyone should be using it, and without it everyone can spy on all your traffic; why is the goal of this fork to bypass that reasonable sounding decision, is it developed by someone who doesn\'t care about privacy?\nA: Quite the opposite actually. I actually think forcing the average Joe to use encryption is probably a good thing despite being a bit anti-choice, because the average Joe likely won\'t be using anything if they\'re not using SSL. I personally run ownCloud in a less typical configuration however; hosting it through both https over the internet, as well as via the darknet over CJDNS, which provides better identify verification than SSL as well as post-quantum encryption light years ahead of what SSL can manage, so this fork is actually to improve security for myself.</string>
